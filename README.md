# DriveSmart---AI-Powered-Training-for-Safer-Roads
This project aims to develop an intelligent driver training system that leverages AI and machine learning techniques to provide real-time assessments and feedback on driving performance. Includes skills to analyze driving simulator data, extract relevant features, and develop models that can assess driving behavior. 

# Aim

 1) How risky the driver is
 2) How risky the simulated driving environment is
 3) How attentive the driver is
 4) how drowsy the driver is. Using machine learning and the MP4 file
 5) outline or annotate all objects in the simulated driving environment that may pose a safety risk to the driver and/or warrant the driverâ€™s attention.
